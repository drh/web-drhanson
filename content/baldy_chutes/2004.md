A great snow year permitted Alta to open the Baldy Chutes on Fri. Jan. 9th, and a group of us&mdash;Paul Allard, Joni Borghesani, Susan Graham,
myself, Gene Myers, and Beverly Riedel&mdash;skied the Main Chute on Sat. Jan. 10th. All of these photos were taken by Susan Graham.

The main chute is the rightmost slot in the view from the Germania chair at Alta in the left photo below. 
We hiked up the Alta side, which is a longer and more difficult hike than the hike from the Snowbird side.
Paul, Bev, Gene, Joni, and me are the hikers in the middle photo.
Note the other hikers in the rocks in the middle photo; these rocks and steep pitch above them are the toughest part of the hike.
I wish I'd had my ski pack. I think I'm the second hiker from the top in the right photo.

After a 45-minute hike, we all rested at the top and Susan took these photos of Joni and Bev and Gene and me.

We had the chute to ourselves; the photos below show, from the left, the chute from the top, Paul about to go in high,
me making a less-than-perfect turn about 1/4 the way down, and Gene resting.
