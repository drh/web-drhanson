On Mar. 22nd, Alta opened both the Alta and Snowbird ridges to the Baldy chutes at the same time.
Usually, the Alta side opens first, so the Alta skiers get the best conditions, and the Snowbird side opens a day or two later.
We were eager to get semi-fresh tracks in Main Chute; we should've known better.
We hiked up through deeper than usual snow in the sun.

The photos below show (l-to-r) Wilma Corkery and Joni Borghesani, me, Bev Riedel, and Wilma, Joni, Bev,
and Bari Levine (who took these photos) on the top of Baldy.

We got to the top just in time to ski the Main Chute in the fog. Worse, the chute had been bombed mercilessly and had slid;
it was either scraped off or littered with piles of gooey poo. It was awful.
I had to stop to knock the snow off my skis because they got too heavy.
Luckily, we heard that the Keyhole route back to Snowbird was also awful, so we traversed around Westward Ho.
To quote Bari: &quot;There was nothing good about that whole fiasco.&quot;
