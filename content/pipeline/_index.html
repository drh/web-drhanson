<p>The American Fork Twins tower over the Gad Valley at Snowbird, Utah.
    There's a ridge between the East Twin (11,443 ft.) and the taller West Twin (11,489 ft.). Dropping off the
    top of the West Twin is Pipeline, a long chute that empties out at Pipeline Bowl in the Little Cloud area of
    Snowbird; it's perhaps 1000 vertical feet. The <span class="text-red-500">red arrow</span> in the photo at the
    right points to the chute. Click <a class="underline" href="http://www.micksmtn.20m.com/aftwin.html">here</a> for a
    description and photos of hiking the Twins in the summer, and

    snowboarding down Pipeline.</p>
<p>On Sun. April 17, 2005, the usual suspects&dagger; hiked from the Tram up the ridge to the East Twin, across
    the ridge to the West Twin, and skied down Pipeline. Click on the thumbnails to reach the corresponding
