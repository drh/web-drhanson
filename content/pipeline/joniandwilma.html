<p>Here are Joni and Wilma as they crest the ridge to the top of the East Twin. We all carried our skis on
    alpine packs (except Rick who just carried his skis on his shoulder), wore avalanche beacons, and carried
    avalanche shovels.</p>
<p>Joni timed the hike: She made it to the East Twin in 43 mins. It's perhaps another 10 mins. to the West Twin.</p>
