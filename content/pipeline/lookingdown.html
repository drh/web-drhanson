<p>Here's the view down Pipeline from the entrance, taken by turning left about 90 deg. from the shot on the
    <a href="{{< relref entrance >}}"</a>previous page</a>. Pipeline is quite wide&#151;at least this year. Indeed, it's
	wider that the <a href="/baldy_chutes/images/mainchutefromtop_04.jpg">Main Chute</a> at Alta this year and
	about the same pitch. Getting to Pipeline is more nerve-racking than skiing it.</p>
