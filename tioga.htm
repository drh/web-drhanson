<p><u><i><b>Note: This page is an edited version of a 6/18/93 email message

<h2>Backcountry Skiing Adventure</h2>
<p>Before we left New Jersey for another summer in Palo Alto,
<a href="http://www.johnrellis.com">John Ellis</a> (Xerox PARC) had offered to 
arrange a camping/backcountry skiing trip in the Sierras for our first weekend 
in California. He promised something mellow&mdash;ha! 
I should've known better.</p>
<p>John made arrangements for me to rent Randonee ski equipment from Marmot 
Mountain Works in Berkeley (which, incidentally, is a great store). We went over 
on 6/10 to pick up the equipment so we'd be ready to leave just after lunch on 
6/11.</p>
<p>Randonee skis are essentially alpine skis with different bindings, and 
they're a bit shorter. I rented Fischer 190cm skis; my regular alpine skis are 
207cm. The bindings have a releasable heel. When released, the ski works like a 
cross-country ski, but it's substantially more rigid and heavier. When the heel 
is locked down, the ski works like an alpine ski. We also rented skins, which 
are mohair strips that are about 2.5&quot; wide and the length of the ski. When 
attached to the bottom of the skis, you can move forward, but not backwards. 
John also had some ski crampons, which fit on the bindings and help keep the 
skis from going backwards.</p>
<p>Randonee boots are like lightweight alpine ski boots, but they're more 
flexible and much lighter, and there's an inner boot that can be worn around 
camp. They're comfortable enough to hike in and to wear all day; indeed, I took 
in only the Randonee boots.</p>
<p>The short summary of the weekend plan was: do a slow hike up on skis (with 
heel released), eat lunch, do a fast ski down (with heel locked down). Of 
course, these two activities take vastly different amounts of time and energy!</p>
<p>Friday, we assembled around 1pm at DEC SRC for the drive to Tioga Pass (about 
240 miles). The group included me and Maylee, John Ellis and Michelle Calos 
(Stanford Medical School), Mark Manasse (DEC SRC) and Janet Mohle-Boetani, and 
Hania Gajewska (DEC SRC). John, Hania, and I had Randonee equipment, Mark and 
Janet had cross-country skis, and Maylee and Michele had small, mountaineering 
snowshoes. Only John, Hania, and I planned to do much climbing.</p>
<p>We drove to Tioga pass and John, Michelle, Maylee, and I camped at about 
6500' in a campground on the other side of the pass; Hania, Mark, and Janet got 
the last motel room in Lee Vining, a small town on the East slope of the 
Sierras. There was lots of snow at 7000' and above; the road opened just 10 days 
or so before our trip, and 8&quot; fell on the previous weekend. Saturday morning, 
the weather was crystal clear, and we assembled at the Saddlebag Lakes trail 
parking lot (just below Tioga Pass at about 9200'), loaded up our packs and 
began a 3-mile hike into a campsite at about 9800' nestled beneath numerous 
peaks. The temperature fell to 36 at 6500' during the night, but it was already 
60 at 8am at 9200'.</p>
<p>Most of the hike in was on skis (carrying a 45lb pack) and slightly uphill. 
We walked for about 3/4 of a mile, but once we reached about 9500', almost 
everything was covered with snow. The trek in took about 3 hours and it was <i>
hot</i>. I was wearing running tights, shorts, a midweight capilene turtleneck 
(opened, of course), a hat, and glacier glasses.</p>
<p>The fun began in the afternoon. John and I started up a drainage toward the 
top of White Mountain. The skis are amazing. I could easily (well,<font face="Times New Roman">…</font>) 
go straight up inclines of up to 15 degrees. On steeper slopes, we zigzagged our 
way up. This is actually more work because it requires an uphill kick turn at 
every change of direction (something I never mastered completely), and it's easy 
for the downhill ski to slip. On steeper slopes, slipping can be sort of spooky; 
there are no moguls<font face="Times New Roman">—j</font>ust smooth snow sloping 
away at, say, at 30 degrees on some pitches. I fell twice, but didn't slip more 
than a few feet. We were also carrying our lightly loaded packs; mine contained 
a parka, bunting pullover, ski pants, an avalanche shovel, and an ice axe. The 
bindings have a heel lift for climbing: it snaps into place so your heel stays 
about 2&quot; off the ski. Achilles tendons love this device!</p>
<p>John and I climbed at a rate of 500-700 vertical feet per hour. I know this 
because John and I both have new Vertech altimeter watches the size of small 
computers (but that's another story). We climbed about 1700' and reached a 
somewhat precarious narrow ridge of snow about 250' under the summit of White 
Mt. at about 3pm. We were at about 11800'.</p>
<p>I took a much-needed rest while John scrambled over rocks and along another 
ridge to the 12057' summit to take pictures, sign the log book, and generally 
feel good. It was also clear to me that I had done a poor job of protecting 
myself against the sun. All of this climbing is above the tree line, and the 
reflection off of the snow was fierce. I've been paying for my mistake all this 
week.</p>
<p>John and I started the trip down at about 3:45pm. This is actually a bit 
late; the snow softens considerably, so the best skiing down is around 1-2pm or 
even earlier. The descent was absolutely wonderful! We skied alone in untracked 
corn snow all the way down on pitches of various steepness. Skiing with a pack 
on short skis was a new experience, but it didn't take me too long to adjust. It 
took us about 30 minutes to descend; we stopped for pictures, water, the view, 
to catch my breath, etc.</p>
<p>While John and I were having fun (and working hard), the rest of the crew had 
set up camp on the snow. After dinner, we turned in early at about 8:30 because 
it got dark and cold. Camping on the snow was a new experience, too. It's cold, 
and some of our gear, which works fine on bare ground, doesn't work so well on 
snow. Thermarest sleeping pads, for example, seem to get cold because the vapor 
in the them freezes.</p>
<p>Sunday, we got up in time for John, Hania, and I to to head up toward Mt. 
Conness by about 8am. Hania and John were eager to <font face="Times New Roman">
‘</font>bag the peak.<font face="Times New Roman">’</font> I was eager just to 
survive. Except for the sunburn, I was in better shape than I expected. I rigged 
a bandana hanging off my baseball hat to protect my face and neck; I wish I'd 
done this a day earlier.</p>
<p>This climb was, on average, steeper, we climbed further, and I was still 
recovering from the previous day's jaunt. Again we climbed about about 700 
vertical feet per hour; we climbed about 2180' stopping many times on the way 
for water and snacks. It's amazing how dehydrated you can get climbing in snow. 
We stopped along with 2 other climbers (and an amazing dog) for lunch at another 
semi-precarious perch at 11970'. One of the other guys was 60 years old, but he 
didn't look it. He said he'd been doing backcountry skiing for 35 years.</p>
<p>We were halfway up a steep pitch and perched at about 300' feet below the 
summit (or, more precisely, the ridge to the summit). There was an enormous 
cornice (6' to over 20' high) blocking most of the way to the summit. After 
lunch, John and Hania decided to leave their skis and try to make it to the 
summit, or at least go look for a way around the cornice. The other 2 climbers 
had already headed up toward the summit. I volunteered (!) to stay and watch the 
skis (and rest, of course).</p>
<p>Much to my discomfort, when John and Hania reached the cornice, they decided 
they could get over it at its lowest point near some rocks. It's difficult to 
describe, but suffice it to say that, up close, it didn't look very safe to me. 
I held my breath while they scrambled over the cornice using their ice axes.</p>
<p>Once over the cornice, they said the walk up the ridge to the summit would've 
been easy, but it was knife-edge ridge covered with snow<font face="Times New Roman">—</font>too 
dangerous. (We learned later that the other 2 climbers didn't attempt the ridge 
either.) Coming down the cornice proved to be quite a bit more difficult than 
going up; it took John and Hania about 20 minutes to negotiate it, and I held my 
breath again. Once over it, they did an entertaining and tension-relieving butt 
glissade back to my perch.</p>
<p>The 2180' descent was terrific! After 3-4 hours of climbing, the ride down is 
really invigorating. We all made wonderful figure-eight tracks on the way down, 
though John's and Hania's were better than mine. Later, we could see these 
tracks miles away. We also took lots of pictures that make me look like I knew 
what I was doing. I did, however, fall once (on an easy pitch, of course). The 
descent took less than an hour.</p>
<p>While we were having fun, the rest of the crew broke camp, packed up, and 
hiked out to tour Mono Lake. We arrived back in the remnants of our camp around 
3:30pm and loaded the packs for the trek back to the cars. After the descent, 
the hike out was a lot of work, although it took us only about 1.5 hours because 
it was slightly downhill (remember, we're on skis). We got to the cars at about 
5:30pm and headed home. I'm sore, but I'm not incapacitated; the sunburn was the 
worst of it.</p>
<p>This trip was the most fun and excitement I'd had in a long time. I'm 
probably now hooked on backcountry skiing, and anyone interested in skiing ought 
to try this at least once.</p>
